linux_config
------------
A collection of configuration files I use on different Linux boxes, and tools
for installing and using them.  Currently contains bash and vim config files.

GETTING STARTED
---------------
Clone the repository and navigate to it's root directory.  Here you can see the various configuration files available.  The 'install-config.sh' script is
provided for copying config files to their default locations on Linux machines.

If you dont want all the files installed, they can also be copied individually.

STATUS AND UPDATES
------------------
THe project is currently under initial development.  Configuration files are
still being cleaned up and added, and the 'install-config.sh' script is
currently incomplete.
